Welcome to our Hackathon Project: Azure Hybrid Cloud – Extending Cloud Capabilities to Local Environments
We live in a world governed by diverse policies, regulations, and compliance standards. Many government agencies and large organizations face strict data residency requirements that prevent them from transferring data from on-premises to the cloud—even when cloud data centers are located within the same country. In some cases, the answer is a firm “no.”
Some organizations demand full control over their data. Yet, the cloud continues to evolve, offering powerful capabilities such as on-demand scalability, improved ROI, advanced AI services, microservices architecture, and more.
So, how can organizations leverage these cloud benefits while keeping their data on-premises?
Yes it’s possible.
With Azure Local combined with Azure Arc, organizations can extend cloud-native capabilities to their local infrastructure without compromising on security or compliance.

How It Works
Azure Arc Integration: Suppose you have a few servers that need to be monitored or managed from the cloud. Azure Arc allows you to integrate these servers with Azure, shifting operational overhead to the cloud while keeping data on-premises.
Full Data Center Control: Whether it's a few servers or an entire virtualized data center, Azure Arc enables centralized control over deployment, workload creation, and lifecycle management—all while maintaining local data residency.
Azure Local Cluster: By installing Azure Local OS on validated hardware and integrating it with Azure Arc, you can create an Azure Local cluster. This cluster appears in the Azure portal, allowing you to deploy workloads, virtual machines, Kubernetes clusters, apps, databases, and machine learning models—all managed from the cloud.

Key Capabilities
Security: Microsoft Defender for Cloud, default application control, and data protection.
Monitoring: Azure Monitor integration with alerts, metrics, logs, and customizable workbooks.
Deployment: Support for Kubernetes, virtual machines, microservices, and more.

Market Opportunity
This solution is ideal for:
Government agencies and defense systems
Organizations with strict data policies
Remote regions without Azure public cloud availability
Retail stores needing localized cloud installations

Now what is stopping you from utilising cloud capabilities?
